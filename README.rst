Follow Along: PyOhio 2013 Kivy presentation
===========================================

The video file for `Ben Rousch's presentation`_ is capped at 480p and makes the code samples difficult to read. To assist viewers I've transcribed the 12 iterations that Ben demonstrates in the first half of his talk as an evolving git repository.

For each step number in the tutorial simply checkout the git branch where ``##`` is the step (01 through 12).

For example::

    $ git checkout step01
    $ python main.py
